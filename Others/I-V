		I
Seeing this makes it easy
Easier to fall
And I can't wait for the end of it all.

You're breathing softly
But much stronger on your own.
No one now can take you from your home.

Stay
All we are is sinking endlessly.

		II
I am not enough
I'm not the demons in your lungs
And I am not enough
To make amends with life or love.

All that was done
You have failed to capture us
Speak spoken love
Offer nothing from your heart.

And I am not enough
I'm not the demons in your lungs
And I am not enough
To make amends with life or love.

I watched you fake a laugh
It was hard for you
We let the time just pass
But it was hard for you.

And every simple task
I noticed it was hard for you
I should have released my grasp
But it was hard for me too.

All that was done
You have failed to capture us
Speak spoken love
Offer nothing from your heart.

		III
I read the note, and I know just what you want to hear
It hurts less over time, but I'm not getting stronger; 
I just leave pieces behind.
I can only fall so many times before I'm broke, unrecognizable
Now all I've left to give is the piece that still remains
And you bring the piece back.
Love, it only recontrusts the pain.
As time fails to elapse
I'm finding you were everything to me.
Now my future and my past are ending tragically the same.

		IV
And now I think my faith is weakening
And just as you bring me back
You push me from the ledge.

		V
I attempt to write for you
And capture all your vision through
What you left for me
Unknowingly.

Now the hardest thing
To begin again
Time may heal the deepest wounds
But a severed limb is gone for good.

My love died with you
I should have died with you
I would have died with you.
